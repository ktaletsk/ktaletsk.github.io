My name is Konstantin Taletskiy and I welcome you in my blog. I will mainly post some details of my main working project, which is implementation of Discrete Slip-Link Model on NVIDIA GPUs. This include theoretical details on model and particular examples of CUDA C++ code.

I might also post some other examples and advices including Qt development & deploying, some tricks on using Ubuntu Linux and so on.
